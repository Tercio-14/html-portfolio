<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Vanderley Santos I was born In Luanda Angola but I have lived in Windhoek Namibia since I was very litte. 
  Additionally to speaking English I also speak portuguese fluently, and am also a conversational speaker of a native 
  language here in Naminbia called Afrikaans.I have 4 wonderful sisters and a very caring mother. If I'm being honest I'd say 
  my life is pretty ok becasue i try to take things day by day and always trust that God has the control of everything.</p>

<p>My hobbies include playing basketball, working out(mostly calisthenics), watching anime, coding, and tring new things 
  whenever I can. I have also recently taken an interest in speaking Japanese because of my love for anime, and I someday 
  wish to go visit Japan, and maybe stay there for a few months.</p>

<p>If you happen to stumble on the first of the many websites I will be creating, and have any question, do not hasitate to ask 
  any questions about myself, and anything related to what I work on, using the email provided on the contact me section.</p>
